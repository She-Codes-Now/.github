### Our Story ðŸ¦„
In 2016, [sheCodesNow](https://www.shecodesnow.org/) was founded by [Alejandra Quetzalli](https://github.com/alequetzalli).

It all started when one of Alejandra's engineering team events did a showing of the following documentary: _CODE: Debugging the Gender Gap_. This 2015 documentary by Robin Hauser Reynolds really impacted her. It helped Alejandra realize she was not alone in how she felt about so many outrageous things that kept happening to Women and minorities in Tech. After the team event, she rallied some co-workers who had attended the same documentary and got them to agree to run a single free workshop for all of the women in their company in their Seattle offices. 

That **ONE workshop** turned into two, then threeâ€¦ and the _rest is history_. 

Since then, sheCodesNow has evolved from only providing local free programming workshops into much more. We provide public speaking training, interviewing resources, and career growth advice for aspiring Women in Tech. Most importantly, weâ€™re still here to hold your hand and give you encouragement during the hard times because we will always believe in you.
